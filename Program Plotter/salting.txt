what is salting?
when you add garbage to data or mess it up

why would we want to salt? 
    compared apple search to google search

Program a salter
    write a program it accepts a csv(onf x y values)
    loop through through y values and +/- a random number from it 
        be sure when you are representing the output
            that you chose a significantly large salt value
            have significant number of data points.(10 is not enough)

Results
    run several tests with different salt values
        testing on plots with high and lpow number of data points
    open in excel and create a graph
        goal is to see the volatility. show all work

Try to reverse the damages
    this is going to be an attempt to smooth the salted data
    smoothing or clearning up damaged data, is common enough.

program graph smoother
write program that loads salted data(technically it could load any data, but its purpose will be to smooth salted data)

have your program loop through and replace the y values with the average of the y values around it 
    you will need to pick a range, wel call it the windowValue
    ex. if range is 3, take 3 points left and right of your index add them and divide
        replace the index value with the new Y value
        iterate to the next x point
        if there are not enough points on left or right, use as many as you can
